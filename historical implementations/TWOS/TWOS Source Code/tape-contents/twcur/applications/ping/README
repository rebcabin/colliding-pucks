
	This version of pong is very minimal.  It doesn't use any Time Warp
features that it doesn't have to use.  The source code is in pp.c, and the
type table is in pongtab.c.  This application is almost the smallest possible
Time Warp application, and serves as a sample of a very simple TW program.

Two objects of type "player" are created.  One is called "ping", the other
"pong".  They trade messages, until, during ping's turn, it notices that the
cutoff time has been reached.
