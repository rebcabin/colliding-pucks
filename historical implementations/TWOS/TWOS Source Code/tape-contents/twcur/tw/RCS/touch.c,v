/*
 * this code broke on the TC2000 since touch was called with
 * an (char *) in timewarp.c and simmem.c to touch the data
 * segment. This could be corrected by changing the parameter
 * to an (char *), but this unit is not logical part of the
 * time warp executive so i was moved (inline) to BF_MACH
 * code areas in timewarp.c and BF_MACH_Hg.c. Thus touch.c
 * is no longer a part of timewarp.
