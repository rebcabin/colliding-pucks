/*

Purpose:

		The functions in this module are responsible for part of
		memory management.  Whenever an attempt to get memory fails,
		these routines try to find queued messages that can be returned
		to their sender, thereby freeing memory for the request that
		failed.  The basic method is to look through the various
		queues for items that are far in the future, and get rid of
		those.  The direction bit on chosen messages is complemented,
		and deliver() is called to send them from whence they came.

Functions:

		m_create(size,time,critical)-  try to create a list element of a 
				specific size
				Parameters - int size, VTime time, int critical
				Return - a pointer to the list element, or a NULL pointer

		make_memory(size,time) - free memory space from queues
				Parameters - int size, VTime time
				Return - 0 if it can't, 1 if it can

		send_back(msg) - return a message to its sender
				Parameters - Msgh *msg
				Return - Always returns 0

		get_message_to_send_back(time) - find a message that can be
				returned to its sender
				Parameters - VTime time
				Return - a pointer to a message, if one was found;
								a NULL pointer, otherwise

Implementation:

		m_create() loops until it succeeds, or is certain that the
		requested memory is unavailable.  At each iteration, it tries
		to allocate memory for the requested item.  If it succeeds, it
		goes no further, simply returning a pointer to the allocation.
		If it fails, it calls make_memory(), to free up some space.
		make_memory() will free up space only from a single object.
		Thus, if the space it frees is insufficient for the requested
		item, it must be called again, until all objects on the
		node have freed the space they can.  This is the purpose of
		the loop in this routine.  If the call to make_memory()
		ever fails, that means that no object could free any space.
		Should this happen, determine if the request was critical
		or not, by consulting the parameter supplied to m_create().
		If the request wasn't critical, return NULL, indicating failure.
		If it was, print an error message and trap to tester.

		make_memory() calls get_message_to_send_back() to find
		one message in some object's queue that can be returned.
		Should one be found, that message is returned to the sender.
		Since it might be a multi-packet message, make_memory() runs
		through a list containing one entry per packet, and each packet
		is sent back.  Return 0 if nothing got freed, 1 otherwise.

		send_back() simply calls a macro to reverse the direction
		bit on the message to indicate that it is going backwards.
		Then call deliver() to ship it off.

		get_message_to_send_back() first decides what time to
		consider as the minimum time to search for.  This time
		is the minimum of the time involved with the item that
		caused the problem in the first place, and min_vt,
		which usually contains gvt.  best_m is set to NULL, 
		indicating that we have not yet found any message to
		send back.  Now loop through all the objects kept on
		this node.  Starting at the end of the input queue,
		look at each message in the queue until one is found
		whose rcvtime is less than or equal to the time of the
		item that caused this attempt to free space, at which
		point go on to the next message, which is guaranteed to
		be at a later time.  Skip over antimessages, and all but 
		the first packet of multipacket messages.  For each candidate, 
		compare its sendtime to the time chosen at the head of this 
		routine.  If this message's sendtime is greater than the 
		best one yet found, set the best time, message, and object 
		to this messages's time, message, and object.  Now make a 
		list containing all packets of the message being sent back.
		Remove all such packets from the input queue.  If the
		removed message was the one pointed to by its object's
		ci pointer, null that pointer.  After the sendback list
