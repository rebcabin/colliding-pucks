
	This tape is a copy of twsim 2.7.1 with an additional directory
called OBJSIZ.  Except for OBJSIZ it is an exact copy with everything
compiled.

	OBJSIZ contains two versions of tws.h (The standard one called
tws-1500.h and a new one with the number of objects set to 2500 and
called tws.h.  It also contains a README.objects which describes the
changes and a shell script called Compare. read the README.objects.

	The easiest procedure is to untar the OBJSIZ subdirectory
into your regular twsim directory and then replace tws.h in that
directory by tws.h in OBJSIZ.  You can always undo this by copying
OBJSIZ/tws-1500.h to tws.h in the twsim directory.

	The Makefiles in twsim should now make the usual libraries
with the new tws.h definition of MAX_NUM_OBJECTS.  You can save the
old libraries under another name before doing this if you want.
