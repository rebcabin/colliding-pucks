

The following is a complete list of the simulator switches as of 11/11/90

	     case 'a':
Enable the archive file procedures

	     case 'b':
Add suffix letters which are an argument required by this switch to
the names of the SIMDATA and TRACE files. (Does not enable either file)

	     case 'c':
Calculate the critical path

	     case 'd':
output simulator data to the file SIMDATA (see also b switch)

	     case 'e':
create an event log file called EVTLOG

	     case 'f':
Make flow table entries for the flow program (the simulator must be
compiled with this feature enabled)

	     case 'g':
don't stop for anything when the simulator is started

	     case 'k':
count the number of events (poll) and stop and print the virtual time
every xx events where xx is an argument required by this switch

	     case 'l':
make the objstats file  (XL_STATS) collect data at intervals of kk.k where kk.k is
an argument required by this switch. (see also s switch )

	     case 'm':
make a file of output messages for each event called MTRACE

	     case 'M':
make a file of input messages for each event called IMTRACE

	     case 'n':
disable most internal timekeeping

	     case 'p':
cause the simulator to fork the pad program and redirect stdout to 
the stdin of pad. Tell pad to quit at end. The simulator must be
compiled with this feature enabled.

	     case 'q':
Stop immediately after starting so that user can enter commands to the
simulator (such as SF to set step switch false and start the simulator).
If -q is not entered on the command line, the simulator does not stop.
If the simulator is stopped because of a switch, multiple commands can be
entered. Start again with a <CR>.

	     case 's':
Do not make a file of cumulative object statistics called XL_STATS in same
format as is used by time warp.  File is now made by default if there
is no 's' switch. See also l switch which should not be used with 's'.

	     case 't':
make an event trace file called TRACE  (see also switch b)

	     case 'x':
do internal timing as though every event time was multiplied by a factor
which is an argument required by this switch. The physical time does not
change.

	     case 'y':
do some stack checking. (for use if timewarp is crashing and it may
be because the stack reserved is too small)

	     case 'z':
enable trace file and change its format so it does not print realtime
or total time

****************************************************************************
Special config file command for TWSIM.
(requires an #ifdef when compiling)

objstats time

Where time is a double.  The -s switch should not be used. -s now suppresses
the file.  This config command will make an objstats record at the time
indicated. It  can be used about 20 times.
A final record will also be made at end of simulation run.
