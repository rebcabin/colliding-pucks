************************************************************************
tw2.6 version starts 6-24-91
************************************************************************
last mods to tw2.6:::::

10-7-91 cubeio.c statsio.c  Change to abolish statsio.c and use the time warp
	cubeio.c for creating XL_STATS.  At this date cubeio.c is modification
	of the TW program because of ifdef SIMULATOR stuff in it.  This will stay
	in the file in some form.  The program also now needs twsys.h which is
	another TW file. It needs an ifndef SIMULATOR in order to prevent
	it from including the twsys.dcl file.

10-25-91  Moved cubeio.c, and friends to the regular distirbution in this directory
	and updated version.c to give this date. Fixed Makefile in Sun3 subdir.

11-7-91	twsp2.c twsp3.c tws.h	Fix memry_pointers field in obj_bod so that it
	is a pointer to the address array for checking pointer fields rather than
	a full size array for each entry amd possible object.  The space is allocated
        only when an obcreate is done.
	This saves much memory and because the BFLY touches all
	the memory to alleviate page faults the program will load much faster on that
	machine (about 5 seconds vs 30 or 40 seconds)

11-13-91	twsp3.c  Change ther dynamic memory alloc/release stuff so that the
	pointer (an index int) returned by newBlockPtr and friends is one
	greater than the actual index into memry.ptrs.  This prevents the program from
	returning a zero on the the first allocation (the index is zero) and makes
	the simulator consistant with TW. StatePtr now returns one more than
	MaxAddresses.

11-15-91 twsp2.c  Clear out the array that is malloc-ed for the
	address table when it is created for each object and also (later)
fix an error in the size of space which is grabbed.

11-19-91 simmem.c	On the Butterfly, mapmem 296 pages. This
	prevents the simulator from getting more pages as it runs
	pucks and also prevents page faults in at least one test.

*********************************************************************
version 2.7 starts on Dec 2, 1991
*********************************************************************
12-2-91 version.c	Changed version and date.
12-2-91	twsp2.c		Added some printout (if debug switch is on)
		 to functions unschedule, guess, and unguess.

 
12-5-91 twsp2.c twsp3.c	Moved memry_ptrs array construction
	program from twsp2.c to twsp3.c. twsp2.c initializes
	pointer to zero.  ptrsetup() now looks for zero pointer
	and sets up the table itself.  fills in the first one at
	that time so no sentinel is needed.

12-9-91	twsp3.c reimplemented statePtr so it simply returns 
	Max_Addresses + 1 and then if pointerPtr reads this
	value it gets the statepointer and returns it.

1-2-92  twsp3.c add size printout to out of memory message in
	newBlockPtr.


1-2-92  twsp2.c return value in type_myArea is now initptr
	instead of initType which is a pointer to a function
	and totally wrong.
