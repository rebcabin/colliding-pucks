This directory contains the TW2.3 versions of the programs needed to 
graph the instantaneous speedup of a Time Warp run. The data which
these tools work with are produced by using the configuration file
directive "islog" for a simulation run. The tools consist of
two programs:

	1). gvtfilter.c - This program converts raw data into a usable
			  format.

	2). ispeeder.c - This program produces instananeous speedup
			data suitable for plotting.

The plotting of instantaneous speedup is intended to be done on a
Macintosh using Microsoft Excel. For a detailed explanation of the 
function of these programs see Section 6.4 of the Time Warp Operating 
System User's Manual.
